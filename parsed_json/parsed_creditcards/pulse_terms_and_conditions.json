What is SBI Card PULSE?\nAns: SBI Card PULSE powered by Visa/Mastercard contactless technology is a fast\nand convenient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless\nchip technology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and\ngive you the freedom to do the things that matter most to you.\n2. How does the SBI Card PULSE work?\nAns: Step 1: Look for the Visa/Mastercard contactless technology mark and contact-\nless logo at the point of sale.\nStep 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount\nwill be displayed on the contactless reader.\nStep 3: Hold your card over the reader at close range (less than 4 cm from where\nthe contactless logo appears).\nStep 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate when the\ntransaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen\nindicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required.\nLook Wave Go\nPlease note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum\nof `5000 for a single transaction.\n3. What are the benefits?\nAns: Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa/Mastercard is specially\ndesigned for you for speed, convenience and security. During a contactless\ntransaction the card never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card\nloss and fraud through counterfeit/skimming. A Visa/Mastercard contactless\ncard has its own, unique, built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique\ncode for every Visa/Mastercard contactless transaction, thus making it more\nsecure. There’s no dipping, swiping or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in\njust a few seconds. Ideal for places like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie\ntheatre etc. You don’t need to look for cash/coins for small ticket everyday\npurchases. It is also easier to keep track of these expenses.\n12\n4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own limit?\nAns: Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a limit of maximum `5000\nfor a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required.\nThis limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limit is not\npossible. Any transaction amount more than `5000 has to be carried out through\nLook, Wave, Go, a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You\ncan also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for\ntransactions amount below `5000.\n5. Where can I use my SBI Card PULSE ?\nAns: You can look for the Universal Contactless symbol at the POS machine at\nmerchant outlets. Also, please visit sbicard.com for details of merchants enabled\nfor Visa/Mastercard contactless payment acceptance.\n6. Can I use my SBI Card PULSE at other merchants (not enabled or contactless",

Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?\nAns: No, as contactless readers will only communicate with one card at a time. If the\nshop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you\nwill be asked to select one card to pay.\n8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?\nAns: No. Your card has to be waved within 4 cm of the card reader for more than half\na second and the retailer must have first entered the amount for you to approve.\nTerminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore\nreducing transaction errors.\n9. Is there any difference in the process for ATM and Internet transactions for the\nSBI Card PULSE?\nAns: There is no difference in transaction process for ATM or any Card not present\ntransactions including internet transactions.

Its purpose\nis to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and\nobjectively.\nHOW DOES THE CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT IMPACT ME?\nWhen you approach the Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will\nbe evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other\nfactors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit\nbeing granted faster and on better terms.\nOn the other hand, a poor past payment record indicate past delinquency and can lead\nto denial of credit or extremely expensive credit.\nTherefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a\ngood credit history for enabling you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit\nin the future.\nHOW DO I IMPROVE MY CREDIT RECORD?\n• Make at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will\nhave the most positive significant impact on your credit record.\n• Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit\n• Limit the number of credit cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards\ncan hurt your credit history.\n• Do not use your credit card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit\nlimit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.\n17\nHOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY?\nThere are a number of things you can do to build and maintain a good credit history.",
