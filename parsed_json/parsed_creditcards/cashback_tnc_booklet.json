          "type": "rewards",
          "text": "\n1. What is CASHBACK SBI Card?\nAns: CASHBACK SBI Card powered by Visa contactless technology is a fast and con-\nvenient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless chip tech-\nnology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and give you the\nfreedom to do the things that matter most to you.\n2. How does the CASHBACK SBI Card work?\nAns: Step 1: Look for the Visa contactless technology mark and contactless logo at\nthe point of sale.\nStep 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount\nwill be displayed on the contactless reader.\nStep 3: Hold your card over the reader at close range (less than 4 cm from where\nthe contactless logo appears).\nStep 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate when the\ntransaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen\nindicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required.\nLook Wave Go\nPlease note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum\nof `5000 for a single transaction.\n3. What are the benefits?\nAns: Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa is specially designed for you\nfor speed, convenience and security. During a contactless transaction the card\nnever leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud\nthrough counterfeit/ skimming. A Visa contactless card has its own, unique,\nbuilt-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa\ncontactless transaction, thus making it more secure. There’s no dipping, swiping\nor fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places\nlike fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatre etc. You don’t need to look for\ncash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of\nthese expenses.\n11\n4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own limit?\nAns: Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a limit of maximum `5000\nfor a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required.\nThis limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limit is not\npossible. Any transaction amount more than `5000 has to be carried out through\nLook, Wave, Go, a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You\ncan also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for\ntransactions amount below `5000.\n5. Where can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card ?\nAns: You can look for the Universal Contactless symbol at the Point of Sale machine\nat merchant outlets. Also, please visit sbicard.com for details of merchants\nenabled for Visa contactless payment acceptance.\n6. Can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card at other merchants (not enabled or contact-\nless payment acceptance) as well?\nAns: Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can\nuse this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.\n7. Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?\nAns: No, as contactless readers will only communicate with one card at a time.
